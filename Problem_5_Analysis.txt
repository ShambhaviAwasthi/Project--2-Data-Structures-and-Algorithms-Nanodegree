Problem 5: BlockChain

Analysis:
A class LinkedList was created and a function to append the blocks was made. The time complexity to add the blocks is O(1) since we are adding the blocks through previous hash as mentioned in the ques.
Space complexity depends on the length of block chain or the space occupied by the block chain.
