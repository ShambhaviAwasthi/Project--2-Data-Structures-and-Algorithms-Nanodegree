Problem 2: File Recursion ( without using os.walk )

Analysis:
Recursive function is used to find all files of an extension type in a folder and its subfolders.
path:        Base directory to find files
pathList:    A list that stores all paths
extension:   File extension to find
I have used exception handling to detect the invalid path as input.
This code has a complexity of O(n) as there is one loop and the rest is the recursive call. The space complexity depends on the depth of dictionary. So it is O(depth of dictionary).
